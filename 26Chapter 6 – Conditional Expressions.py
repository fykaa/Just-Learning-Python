# CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS:
# If else elif are used

'''1. If-elif-elif-elif-else ladder in python'''
# a=2   #prints 3
# a=8 #prints 7
# a=13    #prints 7
# a=14    #prints 13
# a=21 #WILL PRINT 13 kyuki you have  written code  for 13 before code for 17!!!!!!!!! isliye as soon as it gets a positive for a>13 it shows it.
# if (a<3):
#     print("the value of a is less than 3")
# elif(a>13):
#     print("the value of a is greator than 13")
# elif(a>7):
#     print("the value of a is greator than 7")
# elif(a>17):
#     print("the value of a is greator than 17")
# else:
#     print("the value is not greator than 3 or 7")

# PUT
# If-only once 
# elif-as many
# else-only once

# print("done")


'''Multiple if statement'''
# a= 2

# if(a<3):
#     print("a is less than 3")

# if(a>3):
#     print("a is great than 3")

# if(a>13):
#     print("a is greea than 13")



# if(a>7):
#     print("a is g than 7")
# else:
#     print("a is not greator than 7")

# #so you see here that it is considering every if as an idividual command, agar true h to print krra nahi h to nahi. Lekin agar if and else situation ek ke neeceh likhe h to vo use bhi process kr raha h

# print("done")



'''one example'''
# a=11
# if(a>12):
#     print("EVEN")
# elif(a>11):
#     print("odd")
# else:
#     print("prime")


''' example'''
