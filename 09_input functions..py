# Input Functions: this function will allow to take a input from keyboard as a 'string'

a = input("Enter a number")
print (a)



# no matter you enter a number or character here it will  still shoow the type as string
# so now as you see it will give you a chance to print your name directly from the terminal 

a = int(a)
print (type(a))

# now that i have converted string into a intrger using typecasting then it will show class int ONLY when numbers are written
